# css_about_python
Break down the "About Python" image below into proper HTML and CSS. 

- Make sure it HTML is validated and that float: left or right is used.
- For the ">>" on the list, don't worry about making it look exactly like >>. You can just use a normal circle for this assignment. 
- Do NOT make this responsive.  Just make this work for a fixed width (set the width to be 920px). For now, try to master the CSS principles for fixed width first.
